- This is a single page application(SPA) which provides kind of note functionality. <br />
- You can hover over any note, and you can see "Pin" option on the left hand side and "Delete" option on the right hand side.<br />
- By clicking on Pin, you can pin that note, and that pinned note will always display on the top.<br />
- If we have pinned multiple notes, the notes will be sorted by the most recent time the note was created.<br />
- You can also Unpin the note and it will be removed from top.<br />
- If we click on Delete, the note will be deleted.<br />
- Right now, there is no "search" or "add-note" functionality created. We are working with some static data at the moment.
